// Module 1:
String interpolation: It allows to render the value of a property in the template.

Two-way binding: Through this we can update the value of property of the class and it
will update the value of this prop in any place were is used.

ngIf: It allows us to render conditional content. We can use the else statement to render
content when the condition is false and we would need to use an ng-template to render the
content but also we will need to specify an id for the tempalte.
  When the condition is true it will automatically call the 'then' template which is the
template where we call the ngIf directive.

ngFor: This directive allows to iterate through an array and render its content in the
template. The structure is the following one: *ngFor:"let myObj of collection".
 We can also get the index (position of the element in the array) using the prop 'index'.
 To do this we would do the following: *ngFor:"let myObj of collection; index as i".

Interface: Through this we can specify the properties of an object but also the type of
each property. This allows to avoid problems of objects recieving invalid data.

NgSwitch: This allows to handle multiple conditions under. To handle each case we would use
*NgSwitchCase followed by the condition, and if none of the cases are match we would use
*NgSwitchDefault to render something if it failed.
